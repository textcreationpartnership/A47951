         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Indeed it is the great entertainment of Converſation at <hi>Rome,</hi> to relate the ſeveral Stories of <hi>Innocent</hi> the tenth, and his Siſter-in-law <hi>Donna Olimpia.</hi> And ſurely if Oral Tradition be of that force, as the late Innovatours would have it; they themſelves muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs (to their own ſhame and confuſion) the truth of this Story: and by the great example layed before us, that the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith, will do any thing with a Woman, but Marry her.

               </gap> muſt not be expected that the tenth part of the Lady's ſtory is to be found in this ſmall Volume: for I ſuppoſe a full Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would take up more Paper, than tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

Man by ſome Affronts or Injuries, and provoke his Zeal to a more vigorous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of the Work: as God knows, we have all need to be awaked by ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable paſſion to do reaſon: Yet I dare ſay, nothing ſhould tempt him to ſay more than truth. And now, if matters have gone thus at <hi>Rome,</hi> what hopes of Infallibility? <hi>Donna Olimpia</hi> indites to <hi>Innocent,</hi> ſome broad-backed Groom or Coach-man ſuggeſts to her, and where to find the firſt mouth of this Oracle is not to be determined. This Pope was choſe for his Senſeleſneſs: For when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave had been tired out with bandying of Factions, and were reſolved to pitch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome indifferent perſon; not being able to find out any among themſelves honest enough to keep to that Integrity, they choſe this as the greateſt Block-head, and ſo leaſt able to do miſchief. I have heard of an old Civilian, who with drinking Sack and ſtudying the Laws, had ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled his Brain; that having occaſion fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to paſs by a Chappel Door, which
<pb facs="tcp:55125:4"/>
joyned to that he came out of, would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fail to piſs againſt it: and is it any wonder that he who had beaten out his little Wits upon the dull Volumes of the Canon-law, and ſo long doted upon a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſhould do worſe, not only at the Church Door, but within the very Rails of the Altar? In the mean time, though Children and Fools will be pleaſed with Bables: ſhall they think to impoſe upon the reaſonable part of the World, and exempt the Pope from that determination in the Text, <hi>Every Man is compaſſed about with Infirmities?</hi> The Jeſuit brags much of his Harveſt here in <hi>England,</hi> while we hold our ſelves obliged to them for weeding our Church of ſuch Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; who, if the ſobereſt of their own Party be to be believed, conduce more to the ſhame, than propagation of their Sect. So that we may ſay of them, <hi>They Went out from among us, becauſe they were not of us.</hi> However, that which carrys on the work of theſe Eccleſiaſtical Mountebanks much more effectually among us, is that
<pb facs="tcp:55125:4"/>
they ſubtly practice the method of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, tempting the weaker Sex, and through their Charms draw the poor male into their Net. For who can ſhew his head in this Generation, and be ſo little a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, as to deny the impertinent demand of a fair Lady? It is very ſeaſonable therefore this accompt to the World, for a Pope in theſe our days to warn us of the ſad effects of love tranſported beyond the bounds of Honour and Vertue <hi>in his own perſon:</hi> thus to confront the impudence of <hi>Rome,</hi> which, while it pretends to direct all Chriſtians, by I know not what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>entayled Donation, tells us by its pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, what once in the time of the Ligue the Cardinal Legat at his entry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Paris,</hi> ſaid all the time he intimated a Benediction by the croſs motion of his Hand, <hi>Qui vult decipi, decipiatur:</hi> He that will be an Aſs, may. But I ſhall ſtop here, leaſt I ſhould draw a Waſps Neſt about the Aſhes of the dead. The truth is, the Authour is thought never to have deſigned this for the Preſs: but only
<pb facs="tcp:55125:5"/>
writ it to ſatisfie the curioſity of ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Friends. However they, who moſt eſteemed him, judged it fit ſince his Death to eternize his Name, by publiſhing ſo ingenious a Piece. Some were of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to moderate certain Expreſſions: but the moſt thought it not ſo equitable, to impoſe upon the Dead. It is therefore to be taken, as it was firſt brought forth: and if any find ought to ſay againſt it, let them write into the next World to the Authour for an Anſwer, and keep in their right Senſes till it comes.</p>

               <p>But why do I thus decry Writing, while I my ſelf pretend to write? Alas! to write what one is an eye-witneſs of is ſo natural, as the contrary is eſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the world from it ſelf. Give me leave therefore to ſay with the Apoſtle St. <hi>John, What we have beheld with our eyes, what we have ſeen, and our hands have touched: that declare we unto you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will write no other thing of <hi>Donna Olimpia</hi> but what I have ſeen in her. Her deſcent I will omit: only that ſhe was born of the Family of <hi>Maldachini,</hi> which name made but little noiſe in <hi>Rome</hi> at that time. However I would ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry willingly have ſpoke of her child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and education: but that I ſaw her marryed before a Virgin. She was born before me: ſo that I cannot ſpeak of what I have not ſeen, without break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55125:7"/>
my promiſe of delivering only what the Theatre of <hi>Rome</hi> hath repreſented to my eyes for the ſpace of five and twenty years and upwards. I will but deliver what the common report of thoſe, which knew her in her younger dayes, hath informed me of. That from her very infancy almoſt ſhe ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an ambition to rule: inſomuch as at her childiſh playes amongſt her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, ſhe alone would ever give law to the reſt. Thus ſhe grew up, and thus ſhe lived even till ſhe arrived to the years of marriage. It is ſaid, that her Parents, conſidering the ſmall ſhare they had in Fortunes favour, uſed all means poſſible (as it is ordinary in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>) to make her reſolve upon a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick life. But ſhe, that had more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion to Matrimony, than a Vow, denyed flatly to yield to any ſuch pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>She was therefore given in marriage to Seignior <hi>Panfilio,</hi> brother to <hi>Gioanne Baptiſta Panfilio,</hi> who came afterwards
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55125:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to be Pope. Theſe Nuptials were ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated in <hi>Rome</hi> with ſatisfaction on both ſides, as loving reciprocally. Which kindneſs produced a numerous off-ſpring of females, with but one only male, which is <hi>Prince Panfilio,</hi> who ſerved for the ſtate to his Mothers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts. The firſt Scene that repreſents it it ſelf (as I may ſay) in the Tragi-comedy of the Life of <hi>Donna Olimpia,</hi> is the coolneſs of affection towards her Husband; which by little begun to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcover it ſelf, without any grounds the good man could find out for it. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, how difficult ſoever it was to the Husband, the <hi>Romans</hi> eaſily ſmoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the cauſe. Who ſeeing how fond ſhe was of her Brother-in-law, began to have a general ſuſpicion of her vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; as believing for a certain the times of <hi>Herod</hi> were revived. Nor may we blame any for thinking amiſs of theſe two; when their actions, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures and behaviour gave ſo palpable grounds of ſuſpicion.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Donna Olimpia</hi> went much oftner in in the Coach with her Brother-in-law, than with her Husband: entertained her ſelf much more in the Cloſet with the one, then in Bed with the other: and many times the poor Husband knew not where to find either Brother or Wife, that is in plain Engliſh, they always went together.</p>
               <p>There was but one reaſon, which qualified this foul ſuſpicion. And that was, divers debated it, nor could imagine, that a Lady as <hi>Donna Olimpia</hi> who had a body of no ordinary ſhape, ſhould be in love with the uglieſt countenance that ever appeared in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſhape, as it is moſt certain her Brother-in-law was. Eſpecially ſince her Husband had ſomething pleaſing and comely in him, though not exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Whereas this could only give e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence how great is the ambition of Women to domineer: which paſſion blinds them to that degree, they will not only ſurrender themſelves up to Men, but Satyrs.</p>

For the aſpiring Spirits, for fear of letting ſlip ſo fair an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, and knowing the greedineſs of <hi>Donna Olimpia</hi> run as if the Devil drove them to buy Eccleſiaſtical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments: which ſhe beſtowed with her eyes ſhut, ſo they came but with their hands open. I know a Canon that had ſought for a Biſhoprick more than a hundred times, without ever obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.

But now towards the latter end the ſame <hi>Donna Olimpia</hi> ſends for him, to know whether he was ſtill in the mind he he had been formerly; and when ſhe found him a little cool, proteſting to her that a violent tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Fleſh had made him ſpend

two thouſand Crowns upon a lewd Woman: Oh, well, well, ſays ſhe, then you have four thouſand Crowns left, bring them to me, that you may not loſe that which I keep for you, and you ſhall be Biſhop for me; ſo ſhall I not loſe the ſatisfaction of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting ſo worthy a perſon to that Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Thus was he declared Biſhop at the very inſtant he layed down his four thouſand Crowns. Another Clergy Man, that had purchaſed a Benefice for two thouſand Crowns, felt ſuch a remorſe of Conſcience a little while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that he would not go to take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, but came to <hi>Donna Olimpia,</hi> and did beſeech her to accept his ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of that he had never yet entred upon, and only pay him back three parts of what he had given her: for he felt the torments of Hell for the <hi>Simony</hi> he had contracted. <hi>Donna Olimpia</hi> gave him no other anſwer, but that the Pope was yet living, and that he gave him his Benediction; by which

               </p>
               <p>Her Adverſaries by this time began to play their parts: each profering to prove a hundred Miſdemeanours <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Olimpia</hi> had commited againſt the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:55125:97"/>There was not a day paſſed over the Pope's head, that he had not preſent<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed him a hundred Memorials, to de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mand Juſtice againſt this Lady: beſide private Informations without number All thoſe that ſhe had made her Bar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gains with, poſted them.</p>
               <p>Cardinal <hi>Barbarino,</hi> at the entreaty of <hi>Donna Olimpia,</hi> went himſelf to ſpeak to the Pope in her behalf, before matters ſhould be gone too far: but found him ſo averſe to hear of any In<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terceſſion, that he durſt not appear for her, as plainly finding his word would do her more harm than good For he ſaw the Pope ſo zealous for the good of the Church, that in ſtead of Clemency, he recommended Juſtice to him: ſo that he told him at parting <hi>That he wuld treat</hi> Donna Olimpia, <hi>as Prince ought to do with Juſtice, and Pope with Clemency: though her Action ſhewed ſhe had neither Clemency nor Ju<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtice.</hi> But <hi>Barbarino</hi> would not terrifie the poor Lady, by repeating to her
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:55125:97"/>
the ſame words, only wiſhed her to be as wary and circumſpect, as ſhe could.</p>
               <p>Now the Pope began to diſcover his Intentions, of calling <hi>Donna Olimpia</hi> to an accompt for all the Money ſhe had received of the Church: upon which, her Relations fearing to loſe their ſhare of ſo goodly an Inheritance, eſpecially the Prince her Son, all joyned to help her. The Princeſs <hi>Roſſano,</hi> had it been only deſigned to torment her Carcaſs, no doubt would not have ſpoke a word for her: but finding it extend to the Purſe, thought her ſelf obliged for her Childrens ſake, to endevour her utmoſt to preſerve not her, but her Eſtate. However ſome of the Cardinals would not meddle with ſo tickliſh a Buſineſs: as to oppoſe a Pope, who was admired and adored, not ſo much for the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninence of his degree, as his exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary Life. Yet all joyned in this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: that ſhe ſhould ſtand the firſt ſhock, before ſhe fled.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Donna Olimpia</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered

And they ſay he an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſwered the Meſſenger over and above, <hi>That</hi> Donna Olimpia <hi>had been too fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar with Popes, and therefore ſhe might diſpenſe with ſeeing them any more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The private Inquiſitours that I told you of before, who were appointed to learn out the Carriage of <hi>Donna Olim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia</hi> while her Brother-in-law was Pope, brought in daily thouſands of Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt her, that ought to have been puniſhed not only by pecuniary Mulcts, but bodily chaſtiſement. The crys and complaints of ſo many poor Biſhops that were oppreſſed, ſo many worthy learned Men undone, ſo many honeſt Men perſecuted with Hunger becauſe they had not Money to preſent <hi>Donna Olimpia</hi> for a preferment, reached up to Heaven: beſides that many times as the Pope paſſed the Street, you ſhould

               </p>
               <p>Many began already to be ſcandalized at the Pope, that he proceeded ſo ſlowly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>While things were thus wavering, <hi>Donna Olimpia</hi> calls all her greateſt Confidents together, to adviſe how to provide againſt the ſtorm. which ſhe looked upon as unavoidable. There were thoſe that counſelled her to retire from <hi>Rome</hi> into ſome neighbouring

Some would have had her gone to <hi>Loreto, in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cognita,</hi> as out of Devotion: which was not liked for many reaſons. The rather, becauſe not being able to get out of <hi>Rome</hi> without the Pope's Leave and Bleſſing, to be ſure he was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy reſolved to grant or deny, acccord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it beſt ſuited with his Deſigns and thus it would not be diſcretion to make a bootleſs attempt, The Prince her Son, who was by, judged it not convenient to call the Chirurgeon be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore ſhe was wounded: then turning to his Mother, he bid her be of good comfort, telling her, <hi>Madam, the Fool runs away while his Houſe is burning

down. Stay at</hi> Rome, <hi>and think of no other Refuge. Look you but to your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and we will take care of your Eſtate.</hi> Thus was this Conference determined with a ſumptuous Collation: though Cardinal <hi>Barbarino,</hi> who was one there, would not ſtay, but excuſed himſelf after his uſual manner upon ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions.</p>
               <p>That which <hi>Donna Olimpia's</hi> Friends and Relations propoſed for her Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, the Pope executed by way of Juſtice. For he ſent one of his Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers to <hi>Donna Olimpia,</hi> to command her expreſly from him to leave <hi>Rome</hi> within three days, and in eight to be at <hi>Orvieto,</hi> which is a City about thirty Miles from <hi>Rome:</hi> from whence ſhe was not to ſtir, without new Orders from his Holineſs.</p>
               <p>It is no eaſie matter to ſay, how much this Order diſturbed her. Yet ſhe put a good Face upon it; telling thoſe that were about her, that ſhe thanked God, who had given her a Judge, whoſe
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:55125:100"/>
good nature diſpoſed him to nothing but what was juſt; to whoſe Breaſt ſhe referred her Cauſe moſt willingly, as aſſured of her own Innocence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Barbarino</hi> was reſolved to vente<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> another bout in her behalf, againſt his own inclination; but he found the Pope ſo much more hardened than for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>merly, that there was no coming near him; and ſo was fain to take his Leave, with a <hi>Lord have mercy upon us.</hi> The Pope gave him no other anſwer to all his Diſcourſe, than this, <hi>We ſhall take more pity of</hi> Donna Olimpia, <hi>than ſhe had ſometimes of the</hi> Barbarini. The Cardinal caſting down his Eyes with his wonted gravity, remained ſilent; till provoked by I know not what ſugge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtion at laſt, deſired his Holineſs to pardon <hi>Donna Olimpia,</hi> as his Family had done after ſo many provocations. Theſe words ſeemed to warm the Pope a little, without putting him by his conſtant gravity: and he anſwered the Cardinal in his own terms, <hi>You have
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:55125:100"/>
excuſed her, becauſe it was for Your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt: but We cannot, becauſe it will hurt Our Conſcience.</hi> Here the Pope ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and the Cardinal immediately took his Leave, with the uſual Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: returning ſtrait to <hi>Donna Olimpia,</hi> to give her an accompt of what had paſſed. Much about the ſame time, Prince <hi>Panfilio</hi> deſired Audience of the Pope: who made him be told, he would give Audience to none of <hi>Donna Olim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia's</hi> Relations, till ſhe were gone out of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was therefore thought convenient that without any more to do, ſhe ſhould prepare to obey his Holineſs: ſince her delay would do her but an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury. So ſhe went out of <hi>Rome, incogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> the ſecond day after the Order. That night ſhe lay ſome two Miles out of Town, where almoſt all her Friends and Relations came to ſee her, in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, the Cardinals <hi>Azzolini</hi> and <hi>Gual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieri,</hi> who bid her take heart, and fear no colours. The Prince her Son would
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:55125:101"/>
have gone with her to <hi>Orvieto,</hi> but ſhe would not let him: as eſteeming it more ſeaſonable to ſtay at <hi>Rome,</hi> and and ſee how things went. Thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſhe her Journey, and the Prince returned, receiving at his entry into the Town, an affront from ſome Boys that ran about his Coach, and ſung Songs and Libels upon his Mother. It was therefore found good prudence that <hi>Donna olimpia</hi> had conveyed her ſelf ſo privately out of Town, to eſcape thoſe Inſolencies upon her own perſon.</p>
               <p>The Town talked very much upon the commanding this Lady away. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one ſpoke to her diſadvantage with a concerned bitterneſs. Her Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, though Princes, durſt not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſtir abroad for three or four days, to avoid the clamours and invectives of the people.</p>
               <p>The ſame day that <hi>Donna Olimpia</hi> quitted <hi>Rome,</hi> the Pope ordered to begin to take the Examination of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes for drawing up the Proceſs. He
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:55125:101"/>
likewiſe reſolved to ſpeak to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory of Cardinals, that they would refer all to his Prudence and Juſtice.</p>
               <p>In the mean time Prince <hi>Panfilio</hi> had Audience of him, where amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things he told him, that if every Pope ſhould undertake to correct the preſuppoſed Faults of the Relations of his Predeceſſour, it would make a Noiſe in the Church not a little ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous: for the Hereticks would charge all the Blame upon the Popes themſelves, without whoſe concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, his Relations would have been able to have done little. The Pope did not like this Diſcourſe, but told the Prince, <hi>The Hereticks are ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized to ſee Faults go unpuniſhed, and not to ſee them corrected: and it is but fitting that they ſhould give accompt to the Pope, who is to be reſponſible to God.</hi> And ſo he diſmiſſed him.</p>
               <p>The Politicians taxed the Prince very much of Weakneſs and Indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ion, that he would entertain with
<pb facs="tcp:55125:102"/>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:55125:103"/>
ſuch Diſcourſe a Pope, who had inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated ſo great an averſion to his own Kindred, as to ſwear he would never ſuffer any of them to be admitted into <hi>Rome,</hi> or to any Command whatever: though his Predeceſſours had always done it.</p>
               <p>The Examinations all this while went on for accompliſhing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, which they thought would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come to an end, ſo many ſeveral Charges and Impeachments coming daily one upon the neck of another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therefore the Pope appointed that <hi>Donna Olimpia</hi> ſhould firſt give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of what was already brought before him. For which purpoſe his Holineſs ſent a Commiſſary to her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyſhip; to give her notice, that ſhe was to anſwer diſtinctly to theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To give an Accompt of all the Money taken out of the Datary, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any occaſion of the Church requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it: forcing the Officers with Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:55125:103"/>
to comply with her inſatiable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and avarice.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That ſhe ſhould clear her ſelf of what was laid to her Charge, of having ſold multitudes of Benefices: and that upon pain of Excommunication, ſhe ſhould confeſs to the Pope all the <hi>Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> that were committed in her time.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That ſhe would refund all thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſums of Money ſhe had received in Compoſition of thoſe that had Suits at Law, throughout the whole ſtate of the Church.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That ſhe would give accompt what was become of the Revenues of ſo many vacant Benefices, which the Stewards confeſſed to have payed in to her.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To ſhew where the Salaries of ſo many Officers were, which were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to have been carryed to her Houſe.</p>
               <p n="6">6. She was to give accompt for all the Corn ſhe had made be carried out the State to other places, where ſhe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:55125:104"/>7. She was to pay back again all the ſuperfluous Expences ſhe had been the cauſe of.</p>
               <p n="8">8. To count for ſo many Taxes, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſts and Gabels, as were laid upon the people, to their great oppreſſion, by her inſtigation: ſince the Officers that gathered them, confeſſed they had pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all in to her.</p>
               <p n="9">9. She ſhould be obliged immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reſtore all the Jewels ſhe had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the ſeveral Treaſuries, as well of Churches, as the Popes.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And laſt of all, ſhe was charged by more than a hundred Witneſſes, to have received over and above the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Revenue, two Millions and an half of Gold Ducats, for which no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt had been given: and therefore his Holineſs was reſolved ſhe ſhould make it good. This News was hardly ſo unwelcome to <hi>Donna Olimpia,</hi> as it was to her Relations, who expected to be her Heirs: ſo that they went buz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing about like ſo many Bees, to juſtifie
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:55125:104"/>
the Innocence of <hi>Donna Olimpia.</hi> The Lady drew up a formal Writing, to make it appear that ſhe had not Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed her ſelf in the Government, and that whatever came to her hands, ſhe delivered it up to the Pope, who order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and laid it out where there was occaſion, as other Popes uſed to do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</p>
               <p>But theſe excuſes were too weak to ballance ſo many Proofs as were made out againſt her. So that it was verily believed, what was whiſpered about Town, that the Pope was reſolved to Sequeſter her Eſtate, and impriſon her Perſon. It is true, this was but the rumour of the people: but aſſuredly, the Pope intended to have made her give accompt for every particular.</p>
               <p>While Affairs went on in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the dreadfull Viſitation of the Plague, fell upon <hi>Rome:</hi> ſo that moſt of the Courts being ſhut up, common Juſtice was ecclipſed by the great Judgment, Trade left off, Commerce
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:55125:105"/>
among themſelves ſuſpended, and the Pope wholly taken up to ſave as many as he could, to give order for the Sick and the Dead; gave a ſtop to the Proceſs and time to thoſe who were concerned to deviſe a way for <hi>Donna Olimpia's</hi> delivery.</p>
               <p>But if the hand of Man, or rather the Popes, was kept from puniſhing <hi>Donna Olimpia</hi> for a ſeaſon: yet Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that watches while Mortals are aſleep, could not but waken the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Vengeance againſt ſo guilty a creature. The Scourge of the Plague viſited many in <hi>Orvieto,</hi> and amongſt the firſt that died under the execution of that Judgment, was this Lady; who ſurely by her practices, thought her ſelf immortal.</p>
               <p>Thus died <hi>Donna Olimpia</hi> of the Plague in Year 1656. at <hi>Orvieto,</hi> ſome few Months after her perſecution. Her Corps lay above ground two days, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving but few Servants with her, that were all dead before. So that her Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:55125:105"/>
was left to the mercy of the Sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, who were more ſollicitous about her Jewels, than her Carcaſs, which was in a manner expoſed to be eaten by Dogs and Cats. She died without a Confeſſor; which was looked upon as a Judgment upon her, who had ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affronted and oppreſſed the Clergy.</p>
               <p>Her Name was buried in Oblivion for ſome time, while the Contagion ſtopped the peoples mouths: and this Lady, who made ſo much Noiſe during her Life, had not a Mourner to bewail her Death. Though no doubt had ſhe died at any other time, ſhe ſhould have had all the honour of the Church, with a ſolemn Funeral: but in the mean time the <hi>Piazza's</hi> would have been fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ed with <hi>Satyrs</hi> and <hi>Paſquils:</hi> For the <hi>Romans</hi> neither ſpare living nor dead.</p>
               <p>It was thought ſhe left more than two Millions of Crowns in ready Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, beſides Land and Moveables in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimable, and what ſhe had already beſtowed upon her Kindred. The
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:55125:106"/>
Prince her Son was Heir to her Palace in the <hi>Piazza Navona:</hi> which is the faireſt in <hi>Rome,</hi> and where ſhe had he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> richeſt Goods. Indeed, except ſome few Legacies to her Kindred and cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tain Churches, which in all amounted not to above three hundred thouſand Crowns; all the reſt fell to the Prince who took up his Habitation in the <hi>Piazza Navona.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After her Death there was nothing more done: though it was expected the Pope would have come upon he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
